# StatsClass
A gathering place for all my stat's class python code.

Many math formulas are easy to use from different popular python libraries,
but for this repo, I was learning the formulas for my class, and what better way
to learn them then to figure out how to code them?
Why not.

## Standard_dev.py
Use these methods to retrieve mean, standard deviations, and z-score with your data.
## binom.py
A class with methods to find the binomial distribution  
I learned a ton from the Khan Academy courses on statistics while researching to make this code.  
Highly recommended learning resource. 
The values for class BinomDist() init:
 * total_outcome
 * number_of_events
 * probability_of
 * inverse_probability_of
